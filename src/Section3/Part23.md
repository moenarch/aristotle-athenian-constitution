## Part 23

These preliminaries being concluded, the cases are called on.
If it is a day for private cases, the private litigants are called.
Four cases are taken in each of the categories defined in the law, and the litigants swear to confine their speeches to the point at issue.
If it is a day for public causes, the public litigants are called, and only one case is tried.
Water-clocks are provided, having small supply-tubes, into which the water is poured by which the length of the pleadings is regulated.
Ten gallons are allowed for a case in which an amount of more than five thousand drachmas is involved, and three for the second speech on each side.
When the amount is between one and five thousand drachmas, seven gallons are allowed for the first speech and two for the second; when it is less than one thousand, five and two.
Six gallons are allowed for arbitrations between rival claimants, in which there is no second speech.
The official chosen by lot to superintend the water-clock places his hand on the supply tube whenever the clerk is about to read a resolution or law or affidavit or treaty.
When, however, a case is conducted according to a set measurement of the day, he does not stop the supply, but each party receives an equal allowance of water.
The standard of measurement is the length of the days in the month Poseideon....
The measured day is employed in cases when imprisonment, death, exile, loss of civil rights, or confiscation of goods is assigned as the penalty.
