## Part 25

When all the jurors have voted, the attendants take the urn containing the effective votes and discharge them on to a reckoning board having as many cavities as there are ballot balls, so that the effective votes, whether pierced or solid, may be plainly displayed and easily counted.
Then the officials assigned to the taking of the votes tell them off on the board, the solid in one place and the pierced in another, and the crier announces the numbers of the votes, the pierced ballots being for the prosecutor and the solid for the defendant.
Whichever has the majority is victorious; but if the votes are equal the verdict is for the defendant.
Each juror receives two ballots, and uses one to record his vote, and throws the other away.

Then, if damages have to be awarded, they vote again in the same way, first returning their pay-vouchers and receiving back their staves.
Half a gallon of water is allowed to each party for the discussion of the damages.
Finally, when all has been completed in accordance with the law, the jurors receive their pay in the order assigned by the lot.

THE END
