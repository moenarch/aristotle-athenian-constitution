## Part 17

All officers connected with military service are elected by open vote.
In the first place, ten Generals (Strategi), who were formerly elected one from each tribe, but now are chosen from the whole mass of citizens.
Their duties are assigned to them by open vote; one is appointed to command the heavy infantry, and leads them if they go out to war; one to the defence of the country, who remains on the defensive, and fights if there is war within the borders of the country; two to Piraeus, one of whom is assigned to Munichia, and one to the south shore, and these have charge of the defence of the Piraeus; and one to superintend the symmories, who nominates the trierarchs arranges exchanges of properties for them, and brings up actions to decide on rival claims in connexion with them.
The rest are dispatched to whatever business may be on hand at the moment.
The appointment of these officers is submitted for confirmation in each prytany, when the question is put whether they are considered to be doing their duty.
If any officer is rejected on this vote, he is tried in the lawcourt, and if he is found guilty the people decide what punishment or fine shall be inflicted on him; but if he is acquitted he resumes his office.
The Generals have full power, when on active service, to arrest any one for insubordination, or to cashier him publicly, or to inflict a fine; the latter is, however, unusual.

There are also ten Taxiarchs, one from each tribe, elected by open vote; and each commands his own tribesmen and appoints captains of companies (Lochagi).
There are also two Hipparchs, elected by open vote from the whole mass of the citizens, who command the cavalry, each taking five tribes.
They have the same powers as the Generals have in respect of the infantry, and their appointments are also subject to confirmation.
There are also ten Phylarchs, elected by open vote, one from each tribe, to command the cavalry, as the Taxiarchs do the infantry.
There is also a Hipparch for Lemnos, elected by open vote, who has charge of the cavalry in Lemnos.
There is also a treasurer of the Paralus, and another of the Ammonias, similarly elected.
