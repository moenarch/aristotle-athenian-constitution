## Part 18

Of the magistrates elected by lot, in former times some including the nine Archons, were elected out of the tribe as a whole, while others, namely those who are now elected in the Theseum, were apportioned among the demes; but since the demes used to sell the elections, these magistrates too are now elected from the whole tribe, except the members of the Council and the guards of the dockyards, who are still left to the demes.

Pay is received for the following services.
First the members of the Assembly receive a drachma for the ordinary meetings, and nine obols for the 'sovereign' meeting.
Then the jurors at the law-courts receive three obols; and the members of the Council five obols.
They Prytanes receive an allowance of an obol for their maintenance.
The nine Archons receive four obols apiece for maintenance, and also keep a herald and a flute-player; and the Archon for Salamis receives a drachma a day.
The Commissioners for Games dine in the Prytaneum during the month of Hecatombaeon in which the Panathenaic festival takes place, from the fourteenth day onwards.
The Amphictyonic deputies to Delos receive a drachma a day from the exchequer of Delos.
Also all magistrates sent to Samos, Scyros, Lemnos, or Imbros receive an allowance for their maintenance.
The military offices may be held any number of times, but none of the others more than once, except the membership of the Council, which may be held twice.
