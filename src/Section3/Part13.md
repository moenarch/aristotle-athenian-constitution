## Part 13

The King in the first place superintends the mysteries, in conjunction with the Superintendents of Mysteries.
The latter are elected in the Assembly by open vote, two from the general body of Athenians, one from the Eumolpidae, and one from the Ceryces.
Next, he superintends the Lenaean Dionysia, which consists of a procession and a contest.
The procession is ordered by the King and the Superintendents in conjunction; but the contest is managed by the King alone.
He also manages all the contests of the torch-race; and to speak broadly, he administers all the ancestral sacrifices.
Indictments for impiety come before him, or any disputes between parties concerning priestly rites; and he also determines all controversies concerning sacred rites for the ancient families and the priests.
All actions for homicide come before him, and it is he that makes the proclamation requiring polluted persons to keep away from sacred ceremonies.
Actions for homicide and wounding are heard, if the homicide or wounding be willful, in the Areopagus; so also in cases of killing by poison, and of arson.
These are the only cases heard by that Council.
Cases of unintentional homicide, or of intent to kill, or of killing a slave or a resident alien or a foreigner, are heard by the court of Palladium.
When the homicide is acknowledged, but legal justification is pleaded, as when a man takes an adulterer in the act, or kills another by mistake in battle, or in an athletic contest, the prisoner is tried in the court of Delphinium.
If a man who is in banishment for a homicide which admits of reconcilliation incurs a further charge of killing or wounding, he is tried in Phreatto, and he makes his defence from a boat moored near the shore.
All these cases, except those which are heard in the Areopagus, are tried by the Ephetae on whom the lot falls.
The King introduces them, and the hearing is held within sacred precincts and in the open air.
Whenever the King hears a case he takes off his crown.
The person who is charged with homicide is at all other times excluded from the temples, nor is it even lawful for him to enter the market-place; but on the occasion of his trial he enters the temple and makes his defence.
If the actual offender is unknown, the writ runs against 'the doer of the deed'.
The King and the tribe-kings also hear the cases in which the guilt rests on inanimate objects and the lower animal.
