## Part 21

The juror thereupon, after showing his counter again to the attendant, passes through the barrier into the court.
The attendant gives him a staff of the same colour as the court bearing the letter which is on his counter, so as to ensure his going into the court assigned to him by lot; since, if he were to go into any other, he would be betrayed by the colour of his staff.
Each court has a certain colour painted on the lintel of the entrance.
Accordingly the juror, bearing his staff, enters the court which has the same colour as his staff, and the same letter as his counter.
As he enters, he receives a voucher from the official to whom this duty has been assigned by lot.
So with their counters and their staves the selected jurors take their seats in the court, having thus completed the process of admission.
The unsuccessful candidates receive back their tickets from the Ticket-hangers.
The public servants carry the chests from each tribe, one to each court, containing the names of the members of the tribe who are in that court, and hand them over to the officials assigned to the duty of giving back their tickets to the jurors in each court, so that these officials may call them up by name and pay them their fee.
