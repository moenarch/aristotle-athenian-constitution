## Part 3

Such was the way in which the people earned their livelihood.
The supremacy of the Areopagus lasted for about seventeen years after the Persian wars, although gradually declining.
But as the strength of the masses increased, Ephialtes, son of Sophonides, a man with a reputation for incorruptibility and public virtue, who had become the leader of the people, made an attack upon that Council.
First of all he ruined many of its members by bringing actions against them with reference to their administration.
Then, in the archonship of Conon, he stripped the Council of all the acquired prerogatives from which it derived its guardianship of the constitution, and assigned some of them to the Council of Five Hundred, and others to the Assembly and the law-courts.
In this revolution he was assisted by Themistocles, who was himself a member of the Areopagus, but was expecting to be tried before it on a charge of treasonable dealings with Persia.
This made him anxious that it should be overthrown, and accordingly he warned Ephialtes that the Council intended to arrest him, while at the same time he informed the Areopagites that he would reveal to them certain persons who were conspiring to subvert the constitution.
He then conducted the representatives delegated by the Council to the residence of Ephialtes, promising to show them the conspirators who assembled there, and proceeded to converse with them in an earnest manner.
Ephialtes, seeing this, was seized with alarm and took refuge in suppliant guise at the altar.
Every one was astounded at the occurrence, and presently, when the Council of Five Hundred met, Ephialtes and Themistocles together proceeded to denounce the Areopagus to them.
This they repeated in similar fashion in the Assembly, until they succeeded in depriving it of its power.
Not long afterwards, however, Ephialtes was assassinated by Aristodicus of Tanagra.
In this way was the Council of Areopagus deprived of its guardianship of the state.
