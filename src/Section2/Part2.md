## Part 2

After this, seeing the state growing in confidence and much wealth accumulated, he advised the people to lay hold of the leadership of the league, and to quit the country districts and settle in the city.
He pointed out to them that all would be able to gain a living there, some by service in the army, others in the garrisons, others by taking a part in public affairs; and in this way they would secure the leadership.
This advice was taken; and when the people had assumed the supreme control they proceeded to treat their allies in a more imperious fashion, with the exception of the Chians, Lesbians, and Samians.
These they maintained to protect their empire, leaving their constitutions untouched, and allowing them to retain whatever dominion they then possessed.
They also secured an ample maintenance for the mass of the population in the way which Aristides had pointed out to them.
Out of the proceeds of the tributes and the taxes and the contributions of the allies more than twenty thousand persons were maintained.
There were 6,000 jurymen, 1,600 bowmen, 1,200 Knights, 500 members of the Council, 500 guards of the dockyards, besides fifty guards in the Acropolis.
There were some 700 magistrates at home, and some 700 abroad.
Further, when they subsequently went to war, there were in addition 2,500 heavy-armed troops, twenty guard-ships, and other ships which collected the tributes, with crews amounting to 2,000 men, selected by lot; and besides these there were the persons maintained at the Prytaneum, and orphans, and gaolers, since all these were supported by the state.
