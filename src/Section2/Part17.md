## Part 17

This reconciliation was effected in the archonship of Eucleides, on the following terms.
All persons who, having remained in the city during the troubles, were now anxious to leave it, were to be free to settle at Eleusis, retaining their civil rights and possessing full and independent powers of self-government, and with the free enjoyment of their own personal property.
The temple at Eleusis should be common ground for both parties, and should be under the superintendence of the Ceryces, and the Eumolpidae, according to primitive custom.
The settlers at Eleusis should not be allowed to enter Athens, nor the people of Athens to enter Eleusis, except at the season of the mysteries, when both parties should be free from these restrictions.
The secessionists should pay their share to the fund for the common defence out of their revenues, just like all the other Athenians.
If any of the seceding party wished to take a house in Eleusis, the people would help them to obtain the consent of the owner; but if they could not come to terms, they should appoint three valuers on either side, and the owner should receive whatever price they should appoint.
Of the inhabitants of Eleusis, those whom the secessionists wished to remain should be allowed to do so.
The list of those who desired to secede should be made up within ten days after the taking of the oaths in the case of persons already in the country, and their actual departure should take place within twenty days; persons at present out of the country should have the same terms allowed to them after their return.
No one who settled at Eleusis should be capable of holding any office in Athens until he should again register himself on the roll as a resident in the city.
Trials for homicide, including all cases in which one party had either killed or wounded another, should be conducted according to ancestral practice.
There should be a general amnesty concerning past events towards all persons except the Thirty, the Ten, the Eleven, and the magistrates in Piraeus; and these too should be included if they should submit their accounts in the usual way.
Such accounts should be given by the magistrates in Piraeus before a court of citizens rated in Piraeus, and by the magistrates in the city before a court of those rated in the city.
On these terms those who wished to do so might secede.
Each party was to repay separately the money which it had borrowed for the war.
