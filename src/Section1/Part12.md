## Part 12

The truth of this view of Solon's policy is established alike by common consent, and by the mention he has himself made of the matter in his poems.
Thus:

I gave to the mass of the people such rank as befitted their need,

I took not away their honour, and I granted naught to their greed;

While those who were rich in power, who in wealth were glorious and

great,  I bethought me that naught should befall them unworthy their

splendour and state;  So I stood with my shield outstretched, and both were sale in its

sight,  And I would not that either should triumph, when the triumph was

not with right.

Again he declares how the mass of the people ought to be treated: But thus will the people best the voice of their leaders obey, When neither too slack is the rein, nor violence holdeth the sway; For indulgence breedeth a child, the presumption that spurns control,

When riches too great are poured upon men of unbalanced soul.

And again elsewhere he speaks about the persons who wished to redistribute the land: So they came in search of plunder, and their cravings knew no hound, Every one among them deeming endless wealth would here be found.
And that I with glozing smoothness hid a cruel mind within.
Fondly then and vainly dreamt they; now they raise an angry din, And they glare askance in anger, and the light within their eyes Burns with hostile flames upon me.
Yet therein no justice lies.
All I promised, fully wrought I with the gods at hand to cheer, Naught beyond in folly ventured.
Never to my soul was dear With a tyrant's force to govern, nor to see the good and base Side by side in equal portion share the rich home of our race.

Once more he speaks of the abolition of debts and of those who before were in servitude, but were released owing to the Seisachtheia:

Of all the aims for which I summoned forth  The people, was there one I compassed not?
Thou, when slow time brings justice in its train,  O mighty mother of the Olympian gods,  Dark Earth, thou best canst witness, from whose breast  I swept the pillars broadcast planted there,  And made thee free, who hadst been slave of yore.
And many a man whom fraud or law had sold  For from his god-built land, an outcast slave,  I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,  Exiles from home through debt's oppressive load,  Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,  But wandering far and wide, I brought again;  And those that here in vilest slavery  Crouched 'neath a master's frown, I set them free.
Thus might and right were yoked in harmony,  Since by the force of law I won my ends  And kept my promise.
Equal laws I gave  To evil and to good, with even hand  Drawing straight justice for the lot of each.
But had another held the goad as  One in whose heart was guile and greediness,  He had not kept the people back from strife.
For had I granted, now what pleased the one,  Then what their foes devised in counterpoise,  Of many a man this state had been bereft.
Therefore I showed my might on every side,  Turning at bay like wolf among the hounds.

And again he reviles both parties for their grumblings in the times that followed:

Nay, if one must lay blame where blame is due,  Wer't not for me, the people ne'er had set  Their eyes upon these blessings e'en in dreams:-  While greater men, the men of wealthier life,  Should praise me and should court me as their friend.
For had any other man, he says, received this exalted post,

He had not kept the people hack, nor ceased  Til he had robbed the richness of the milk.
But I stood forth a landmark in the midst,  And barred the foes from battle.
