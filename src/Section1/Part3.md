## Part 3

Now the ancient constitution, as it existed before the time of Draco, was organized as follows.
The magistrates were elected according to qualifications of birth and wealth.
At first they governed for life, but subsequently for terms of ten years.
The first magistrates, both in date and in importance, were the King, the Polemarch, and the Archon.
The earliest of these offices was that of the King, which existed from ancestral antiquity.
To this was added, secondly, the office of Polemarch, on account of some of the kings proving feeble in war; for it was on this account that Ion was invited to accept the post on an occasion of pressing need.
The last of the three offices was that of the Archon, which most authorities state to have come into existence in the time of Medon.
Others assign it to the time of Acastus, and adduce as proof the fact that the nine Archons swear to execute their oaths 'as in the days of Acastus,' which seems to suggest that it was in his time that the descendants of Codrus retired from the kingship in return for the prerogatives conferred upon the Archon.
Whichever way it may be, the difference in date is small; but that it was the last of these magistracies to be created is shown by the fact that the Archon has no part in the ancestral sacrifices, as the King and the Polemarch have, but exclusively in those of later origin.
So it is only at a comparatively late date that the office of Archon has become of great importance, through the dignity conferred by these later additions.
The Thesmothetae were many years afterwards, when these offices had already become annual, with the object that they might publicly record all legal decisions, and act as guardians of them with a view to determining the issues between litigants.
Accordingly their office, alone of those which have been mentioned, was never of more than annual duration.

Such, then, is the relative chronological precedence of these offices.
At that time the nine Archons did not all live together.
The King occupied the building now known as the Boculium, near the Prytaneum, as may be seen from the fact that even to the present day the marriage of the King's wife to Dionysus takes place there.
The Archon lived in the Prytaneum, the Polemarch in the Epilyceum.
The latter building was formerly called the Polemarcheum, but after Epilycus, during his term of office as Polemarch, had rebuilt it and fitted it up, it was called the Epilyceum.
The Thesmothetae occupied the Thesmotheteum.
In the time of Solon, however, they all came together into the Thesmotheteum.
They had power to decide cases finally on their own authority, not, as now, merely to hold a preliminary hearing.
Such then was the arrangement of the magistracies.
The Council of Areopagus had as its constitutionally assigned duty the protection of the laws; but in point of fact it administered the greater and most important part of the government of the state, and inflicted personal punishments and fines summarily upon all who misbehaved themselves.
This was the natural consequence of the facts that the Archons were elected under qualifications of birth and wealth, and that the Areopagus was composed of those who had served as Archons; for which latter reason the membership of the Areopagus is the only office which has continued to be a life-magistracy to the present day.
