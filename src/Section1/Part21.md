## Part 21

The people, therefore, had good reason to place confidence in Cleisthenes.
Accordingly, now that he was the popular leader, three years after the expulsion of the tyrants, in the archonship of Isagoras, his first step was to distribute the whole population into ten tribes in place of the existing four, with the object of intermixing the members of the different tribes, and so securing that more persons might have a share in the franchise.
From this arose the saying 'Do not look at the tribes', addressed to those who wished to scrutinize the lists of the old families.
Next he made the Council to consist of five hundred members instead of four hundred, each tribe now contributing fifty, whereas formerly each had sent a hundred.
The reason why he did not organize the people into twelve tribes was that he might not have to use the existing division into trittyes; for the four tribes had twelve trittyes, so that he would not have achieved his object of redistributing the population in fresh combinations.
Further, he divided the country into thirty groups of demes, ten from the districts about the city, ten from the coast, and ten from the interior.
These he called trittyes; and he assigned three of them by lot to each tribe, in such a way that each should have one portion in each of these three localities.
All who lived in any given deme he declared fellow-demesmen, to the end that the new citizens might not be exposed by the habitual use of family names, but that men might be officially described by the names of their demes; and accordingly it is by the names of their demes that the Athenians speak of one another.
He also instituted Demarchs, who had the same duties as the previously existing Naucrari,-the demes being made to take the place of the naucraries.
He gave names to the demes, some from the localities to which they belonged, some from the persons who founded them, since some of the areas no longer corresponded to localities possessing names.
On the other hand he allowed every one to retain his family and clan and religious rites according to ancestral custom.
The names given to the tribes were the ten which the Pythia appointed out of the hundred selected national heroes.
