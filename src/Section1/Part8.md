## Part 8

The elections to the various offices Solon enacted should be by lot, out of candidates selected by each of the tribes.
Each tribe selected ten candidates for the nine archonships, and among these the lot was cast.
Hence it is still the custom for each tribe to choose ten candidates by lot, and then the lot is again cast among these.
A proof that Solon regulated the elections to office according to the property classes may be found in the law still in force with regard to the Treasurers, which enacts that they shall be chosen from the Pentacosiomedimni.
Such was Solon's legislation with respect to the nine Archons; whereas in early times the Council of Areopagus summoned suitable persons according to its own judgement and appointed them for the year to the several offices.
There were four tribes, as before, and four tribe-kings.
Each tribe was divided into three Trittyes [=Thirds], with twelve Naucraries in each; and the Naucraries had officers of their own, called Naucrari, whose duty it was to superintend the current receipts and expenditure.
Hence, among the laws of Solon now obsolete, it is repeatedly written that the Naucrari are to receive and to spend out of the Naucraric fund.
Solon also appointed a Council of four hundred, a hundred from each tribe; but he assigned to the Council of the Areopagus the duty of superintending the laws, acting as before as the guardian of the constitution in general.
It kept watch over the affairs of the state in most of the more important matters, and corrected offenders, with full powers to inflict either fines or personal punishment.
The money received in fines it brought up into the Acropolis, without assigning the reason for the mulct.
It also tried those who conspired for the overthrow of the state, Solon having enacted a process of impeachment to deal with such offenders.
Further, since he saw the state often engaged in internal disputes, while many of the citizens from sheer indifference accepted whatever might turn up, he made a law with express reference to such persons, enacting that any one who, in a time civil factions, did not take up arms with either party, should lose his rights as a citizen and cease to have any part in the state.
